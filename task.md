## Task: Simple Web2 and Web3 Integration

### Objective:
Create a simple backend service using Node.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, and MongoDB that interacts with a deployed Ethereum smart contract. This project demonstrates your ability to handle both Web2 (traditional database) and Web3 (blockchain) integrations.

### Task Description:
1. Web3 Interaction (Blockchain):
    * Use or deploy a basic Solidity smart contract on an Ethereum testnet (Rinkeby or Goerli). You can use a simple contract like a counter or storage contract.
    * Use Web3.js or Ethers.js in your backend to interact with the contract.
    * Create a GraphQL API with:
        i. Query: Fetch data from the smart contract (e.g., a stored value or counter).
        ii. Mutation: Write data to the smart contract (e.g., increment a counter or update a value).
2. Web2 Interaction (Traditional Backend):
    * Set up a simple MongoDB collection (e.g., a list of users or items).
    * Create two more GraphQL API operations:
        i. Query: Fetch a list of records from the MongoDB database.
        ii. Mutation: Add a new record to the MongoDB collection.
3. Deployment:
    * Deploy your project to any cloud platform (AWS Lambda, Heroku, Vercel, etc.).
    * Provide a working GraphQL endpoint and a GitHub repository with your code.

### Submission Requirements:
    * Link to the deployed GraphQL API.
    * Link to the GitHub repository with the backend code.
